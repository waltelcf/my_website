# Climate change is real. 


```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1,

               names_to="Month", 
               values_to = "delta")

skim(tidyweather)
```

## Increase in Weather Anomalies over time

```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies have increased over time", 
    x = "Year", 
    y = "Temperature Change"
  )

```

> The overall trend indicates that there is an increased level of temperature/weather anomaly over time. The increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could be the reason for such increased deviations. 


## Weather Anomalies by Month

```{r facet_wrap}

tidyweather$Month = factor(tidyweather$Month,levels=month.abb)

tidyweather %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date,y=delta))+
  geom_point(size= 1)+
  geom_smooth(color="tomato")+
  facet_wrap(~Month)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Months share similar weather anomalies",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Temperature Change")


```

> Months seem to share similar weather anomalies. However, it is also apparent that the winter months, such as December, January & February tend to be more random in terms of temperature deviation than summer months. 

## The most recent time period shows the largest temperature deviations ever. 


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     
 
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))%>%
  select(1:4,7)

```


```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   
  theme_bw() +              
  labs (
    title = "Temperature Deviations are getting worse",
    y     = "Density",
    x = "Temperature Deviation"
  )

```

## Average temperature deviations support the global warming theorem


```{r averaging}

average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   
  dplyr::summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Temperature Anamolies are the new normal",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )
  

```


## Confidence Interval for temperature anamolies


> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_delta,
            delta_low = annual_average_delta - margin_of_error,
            delta_high = annual_average_delta + margin_of_error

       y= "average annual delta", 
       title="Confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011") + 
  theme_bw()+
  coord_flip()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  NULL
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

```

> With 95% certainty, we can deduct that the population mean is within the interval of 0.917 and 1.02. In other words, we can be 95% sure that during the interval of 2011 till present the mean anomaly is close to 1 degree.
