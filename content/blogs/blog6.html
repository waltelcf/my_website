<blockquote>
<p>One common explanation for the Brexit outcome was fear of immigration and opposition to the EU’s more open border policy. We can check the relationship (or correlation) between the proportion of native born residents in a constituency and its <code>leave_share</code>. To do this, we will analyze the brexit voting result and get the correlation between the two variables.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The trend line in the scatterplot above shows a positive relationship between the percent of the vote cast in favour of Brexit and the proportion of native-born residents in a constituency. The result is aligned with the explanation of Brexit mentioned above, as the constituencies with a higher percentage of the vote cast in favour of Brexit has more native-born residents, who are opposed to the EU’s open border policy and increase immigration. Fundamentally, people are afraid that the open border policy and migration would lead to a higher unemployment rate for UK citizens and greater income inequality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, one may argue that the trend line is not representative of the scatterplot, and there might be factors other than the proportion of native-born residents that contribute to Brexit. Most of the data points in the scatterplot are centered right side of the X-axis, since most of the constituencies have more than 90% of native-born residents. The percent of vote cast from these constituencies also vary from 40% - 70% and thus making the trendline less representative. Other demographic factors that might contribute to Brexit include age, occupations, educational attainment, income level, etc.</p>
